Command Line Utility
====================

Use the FZF Python class as a command line utility.

Note that FZF is *already* a command line utility and is far more powerful than this package when used correctly.

.. code:: sh

  $ py -m fzflib --help

  usage: __main__.py [-h] [--multi]

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    --multi     Mutliple selections. Default: False
